### `node app.js`

You can run this command `node app.js` under the folder server and my section of the application will come up, with login, registering and the game section. The urls are `http://localhost:3000/` for the welcome page, `http://localhost:3000/register` to register an account `http://localhost:3000/login` to login and `http://localhost:3000/games` for the games page

Seems like the code was separated into the react and express frameworks (where npm start only works in the server folder), I'm currently testing with ejs and mongodb and I'll reformat once everything is working!

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
